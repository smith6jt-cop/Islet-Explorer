## Overview

### Data Source

The app loads from a single enriched H5AD file (`data/islet_explorer.h5ad`, ~70 MB) containing:

- **5,214 islets** from 15 nPOD donors (ND, Aab+, T1D)
- **31 protein markers** (mean expression per islet)
- **Pseudotime trajectory** (DPT with INS root, scVI-corrected)
- **21 phenotype proportions** (from single-cell phenotyping)
- **Donor demographics** (age, gender, autoantibody status)
- **62 neighborhood metrics** (peri-islet composition, immune infiltration, enrichment z-scores, distances)
- **QuPath groovy data** (targets, markers, composition, LGALS3)

If the H5AD is unavailable, the app falls back to `data/master_results.xlsx` with reduced functionality (no phenotype proportions, no demographics, no neighborhood metrics).

### Disease Groups

| Group | Color | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| **ND** | Steel Blue (#4477AA) | Non-diabetic control donors |
| **Aab+** | Burnt Umber (#CC6633) | Autoantibody-positive (pre-T1D) |
| **T1D** | Forest Green (#228833) | Type 1 diabetic donors |

Colors are configurable via the **Donor Status Colors** palette selector (Paul Tol default, Bright, Okabe-Ito, Diverging). The selector is available on the Plot sidebar, Trajectory tab, and Spatial tab — all stay synced.

---

## Plot Tab

The Plot tab is the primary exploration interface. It has a **sidebar** (left) and **main panel** (right).

### Sidebar Controls

- **Mode**: Switch between `Scatter` (feature vs diameter) and `Composition` (cell type proportions)
- **Feature/Composition selector**: Choose what to plot
  - *Scatter mode*: Select from markers (31 proteins) or targets (hormone intensities)
  - *Composition mode*: Four option groups:
    - **Hormone Fractions** — INS, GCG, SST fractions
    - **Cell Type Proportions** — 21 phenotype proportions from single-cell data
    - **Peri-Islet Proportions** — Proportions of each phenotype in the 20 μm expansion zone around the islet
    - **Immune Metrics** — `immune_frac_peri`, `immune_frac_core`, `immune_ratio`, `cd8_to_macro_ratio`, `tcell_density_peri`
- **Region**: Filter by tissue region (core only, peri-islet, or all)
- **Donor Status**: Select disease groups to include (ND, Aab+, T1D)
- **AAb Filter**: Filter by autoantibody positivity (when available)
- **Age Range**: Slider to restrict donor age (H5AD only)
- **Sex**: Checkbox filter (H5AD only)
- **Min cells/islet**: Filter out islets with fewer than N total cells (core + peri). Default: 1 (no filter). Increase to reduce noise from poorly-measured small islets.
- **Diameter Range**: Restrict islet diameter in μm

### Main Panel

- **Scatter/Distribution Plot**: Interactive Plotly scatter (diameter vs feature value) or distribution comparison (violin/box by disease stage)
- **Outlier Table**: Lists extreme values for the selected feature
- **Click Interaction**: Click any data point to open the segmentation viewer (see [Single-Cell Drill-Down](#single-cell-drill-down))

### Tips

- Use composition mode with "Peri-Islet Proportions" to visualize the cellular microenvironment around each islet
- The "Immune Metrics" group provides pre-computed ratios that highlight immune infiltration differences between disease stages
- Log-scale features (e.g., cell counts) use pseudo-log transformation so zero values remain visible at y=0

---

## Trajectory Tab

Visualizes the disease progression trajectory computed via diffusion pseudotime (DPT) with INS as the root anchor.

### Layout

The Trajectory tab uses a full-width layout (no sidebar). All controls are inline.

### Components

1. **UMAP Scatter** — Interactive Plotly UMAP colored by:
   - Donor status (default)
   - Selected feature (viridis inferno colormap, scaled to data min/max)
   - Pseudotime (DPT)

2. **Donor Status Heatmap** — Mean marker expression across pseudotime bins, split by disease group. Shows how protein expression changes along the trajectory.

3. **Multi-Feature Heatmap** — Z-scored expression of user-selected markers along pseudotime bins. Default markers: INS, GCG, SST, CD3e, CD8a, CD68, CD45, HLADR. Blue-white-red diverging colormap, z-scores clamped to [-2.5, 2.5].

4. **Click Interaction** — Click any UMAP point to:
   - Highlight the selected islet
   - Open the segmentation viewer panel
   - Jump to the OME-TIFF Viewer tab for that donor

### Controls

- **Feature selector**: Choose which protein marker to display on the y-axis
- **Trend lines**: None, Overall (single LOESS), or By Donor Status (ND/Aab+/T1D separate LOESS curves)
- **Color points by**: Donor Status (default) or Donor ID
- **Point size by**: Cell Count (default), Islet Diameter, or Uniform
  - *Cell Count* sizes points by `sqrt(total_cells)` — small islets (3-10 cells) appear as tiny dots, large islets (100+ cells) as large dots. This honestly represents measurement quality.
- **Point transparency**: Adjustable alpha (0.1-1.0)
- **Point size**: Base point size slider (0.5-5.0)
- **Min cells/islet**: Filter out islets with fewer than N total cells. Default: 1 (no filter). Increase to focus on well-measured islets.

### Cell-Count-Weighted Trends

Trend lines are weighted by `log1p(cell count)` so that well-measured islets (many cells) drive the biological signal while noisy small islets (few cells) contribute proportionally less. This is important because 60% of islets have ≤10 cells — their aggregated expression values are inherently noisier.

Hover over any point to see its cell count in the tooltip (e.g., "Cells: 3"). Small islets at unexpected positions (e.g., ND islets at high pseudotime) typically have very few cells.

### Key Biological Insights

- **INS vs pseudotime**: Strong negative correlation (r = -0.591) — insulin decreases along the trajectory
- **Disease ordering**: ND (early) → Aab+ (middle) → T1D (late) along pseudotime
- **GCG increase**: Glucagon expression increases as insulin decreases, reflecting alpha cell persistence

---

## Viewer Tab

Embedded OME-TIFF viewer (Avivator) for full-resolution multiplexed imaging data.

### Usage

1. Select a donor case from the dropdown, or click an islet in Plot/Trajectory to auto-navigate
2. The viewer loads the corresponding OME-TIFF with configurable channel overlays
3. Channel controls allow toggling individual markers and adjusting intensity ranges

### Requirements

- OME-TIFF files must be accessible at the configured URL
- Avivator runs client-side in the browser (WebGL required)

---

## Statistics Tab

Rigorous statistical analysis of the currently selected feature from the Plot sidebar. The Statistics tab **shares the Plot sidebar** — changing the feature, filters, or disease groups in the sidebar updates both Plot and Statistics simultaneously.

The tab uses a **5-section narrative layout** that walks you through a logical analytical flow, with numbered headings and brief explanations at each step.

### Section 1: Configure Analysis

- Overview banner showing N islets, global p-value, effect size (η²)
- **Run Statistics** button triggers computation; **Download CSV** exports results
- Test type selector with inline explanations:
  - **Parametric** (ANOVA / t-test): assumes roughly normal data within groups
  - **Non-parametric** (Kruskal-Wallis / Wilcoxon): no normality assumption; based on ranks
- Additional controls: significance level (α), outlier removal (>3 SD), bin width, diameter range

### Section 2: Primary Results

Three equal-height cards showing the core statistical results:

- **Hypothesis Testing** (left): Global test + pairwise comparisons table with Cohen's d effect sizes, 95% CIs, and BH-corrected p-values. The primary "Overall" row uses a mixed-effects model with donor as random intercept. The "Donor-level means" row averages islets within each donor (N=15) as a conservative cross-check.
- **Effect Size Forest Plot** (center): Visual display of pairwise Cohen's d with confidence intervals. Points colored by significance.
- **Area Under Curve** (right): Trapezoidal AUC by disease group with percentage change relative to ND baseline.

### Section 3: Size-Dependent Patterns

Stratified analysis testing whether group differences depend on islet size (effect modification):

- **Stratified Tests by Islet Diameter**: Heatmap of BH-corrected q-values (ANOVA and Kendall τ) computed within each diameter bin. Identifies which size ranges drive or lack group differences. P-values are corrected across bins to control false discovery rate.
- **Trend Analysis (Kendall τ)**: Measures correlation between disease stage (ND=0, Aab+=1, T1D=2) and the feature value within each size bin. τ > 0 means the feature increases with disease progression; τ < 0 means it decreases. Points colored by significance (red = significant, grey = NS).

### Section 4: Confounders & Deeper Analysis

Full-width **Demographics** card (H5AD only, hidden for Excel fallback):

- **Donor Summary Table**: N islets (primary), N donors, age median/range, % male/female per disease group
- **Age vs Feature** (left): Islet-level scatter plot (all ~5,214 islets) with overall linear regression line and Pearson correlation. Subtitle notes that islets are correlated within donors.
- **Sex vs Feature** (right): Box plot of feature value by donor status, faceted by sex (Male/Female). Sex-stratified p-values shown in subtitle.
- **Autoantibody Profile** (Aab+ only, hidden when no AAb data): Per-donor table showing which AAbs are positive, total AAb count, N islets, and mean feature value. Box plot of feature by number of positive autoantibodies (1, 2, 3+) with Kruskal-Wallis test.
- **Covariate-Adjusted Model**: Donor-level linear model adjusting for age and sex, testing whether donor status retains significance.

### Section 5: Methods Reference

Dynamic text (subdued grey background) describing all statistical tests, corrections, and assumptions. Adjusts based on test type and parameters selected in Section 1.

### Using the Statistics Tab

1. Select a feature in the Plot sidebar (e.g., `immune_frac_peri`)
2. Switch to the Statistics tab
3. Adjust test parameters in Section 1 (Configure Analysis)
4. Click **Run Statistics** — all sections populate
5. Review the narrative flow: global test → effect sizes → size-dependent patterns → confounders

---

## Spatial Tab

Tissue-wide spatial visualization and peri-islet microenvironment analysis. Combines single-cell tissue scatter plots with Leiden clustering and neighborhood enrichment metrics.

### 3-Panel Layout

1. **Controls Sidebar** (left panel)
   - Donor selector (15 nPOD donors with disease status labels)
   - Color by: Phenotype (21 cell types) or Leiden cluster
   - Leiden resolution dropdown (0.3, 0.5, 0.8, 1.0) — visible when Leiden coloring selected
   - Region filter: All cells, Core + Peri only, or Core only
   - **Color background cells**: Toggle to show tissue background cells in phenotype colors (dimmed) instead of grey
   - **Phenotype filter**: Show/hide individual phenotypes with checkboxes. Use **All** / **None** links to quickly select or clear all types. Dynamically populated from the selected donor's cell types.
   - Donor status checkboxes
   - Phenotype and Donor Status palette selectors
   - Download CSV button

2. **Tissue Scatter** (center, 800px height)
   - Full tissue-wide scatter plot of ~177K cells per donor
   - Background: tissue cells in light grey by default, or colored by phenotype when "Color background cells" is checked
   - Foreground: core/peri cells colored by phenotype or Leiden cluster
   - Spatial coordinate convention: `coord_fixed()` + `scale_y_reverse()` (microscopy standard)
   - **Zoom**: Drag to select a region, then the view zooms in. Double-click or click **Reset Zoom** to restore the full view.
   - Uses ggplot2 `renderPlot` (not plotly) for performance at >100K points

3. **Leiden Panel** (right)
   - UMAP scatter of 5,214 islets colored by selected Leiden resolution
   - Stacked bar chart of mean phenotype composition per cluster
   - UMAP shows disease-stage separation (uses raw marker PCA visualization coordinates)
   - Hidden with message when Leiden data unavailable in H5AD

### Data Sources

- **Tissue CSVs**: `data/donors/{imageid}.csv` (15 files, ~78 MB total). Columns: X/Y centroids (μm), phenotype, cell_region (core/peri/tissue), islet_name.
- **Leiden clustering**: Stored in `islet_explorer.h5ad` .obs as `leiden_0.3`, `leiden_0.5`, `leiden_0.8`, `leiden_1.0` + UMAP coords `leiden_umap_1`, `leiden_umap_2`.
- **Neighborhood metrics**: 62 columns merged into H5AD .obs (peri-islet composition, immune, enrichment z-scores, distances).

### Neighborhood Analysis Cards

Below the tissue scatter and Leiden panel, three interactive analysis sections visualize the 62 computed peri-islet neighborhood metrics. Each answers a key biological question about immune-islet interactions in T1D progression. These cards only appear when neighborhood data is available in the H5AD (not in Excel fallback mode).

**Global Controls** (toolbar above the cards):
- **Min cells/islet**: Filter out small islets with few cells (default: 1, i.e., no filter). Higher values (e.g., 50) reduce noise from poorly-measured islets and decrease NA rates in distance metrics.
- **Point size** and **Opacity**: Adjust scatter plot visualization across all cards.
- **Islet count**: Shows how many islets pass the current filters.

**Card A: Immune Infiltration**
- **Left**: Violin plot of a selectable immune metric (immune fraction peri/core, T-cell density, CD8/macrophage ratio, peri/core immune ratio) by disease stage (ND → Aab+ → T1D). Shows Kruskal-Wallis p-value. Jittered points overlay with box + mean line.
- **Right**: Scatter of peri vs core immune fraction with dashed y=x diagonal. Points above the line have more core than peri infiltration.
- *Interpretation*: Higher immune fractions in T1D indicate increased immune surveillance.

**Card B: Immune Cell Enrichment**
- **Left**: Grouped bar chart of 7 immune cell types (CD8+ T-cell, CD4+ T-cell, T cell, B cell, Macrophage, APCs, Immune) grouped by disease stage. Toggle median/mean summary; clip extreme z > 5 (default on). Error bars show IQR (median) or SEM (mean).
- **Right**: Heatmap — cell types (columns) × disease stages (rows). Numeric values annotated on each cell.
- **Region toggle**: Switch between:
  - *Peri-islet (enrichment z)*: Poisson z-scores comparing peri-islet vs tissue-wide. Diverging colorscale (blue = depleted, red = enriched). Default.
  - *Core (proportion)*: Raw cell type proportions in islet core. Sequential colorscale (white → red).
  - *Peri-islet (proportion)*: Raw cell type proportions in peri-islet zone. Sequential colorscale.
- *Interpretation*: z > 0 means that cell type is enriched near islets relative to the tissue-wide proportion. CD8+ T-cell enrichment in T1D suggests targeted immune surveillance.

**Card C: Immune Proximity**
- **Left**: Box plot of minimum distance (μm) from islet core centroid to nearest immune cells. Selectable metrics: any immune cell, macrophage, CD8+ T-cell (sparse, ~89% NA). Shows non-NA counts per group. 99th percentile outlier clipping (toggle on/off) for cleaner visualization.
- **Right**: Scatter of selected enrichment z-score vs selected distance metric. Expected negative correlation (closer = more enriched). Pearson r shown in title. Percentile-based outlier clipping on both axes.
- *Interpretation*: Shorter distances suggest active immune targeting. CD8+ T-cell distances are sparse because most islets lack nearby CD8+ T-cells — NA values indicate zero immune cells of that type in the peri-islet zone (biological, not a data error). Increase the min cells/islet filter to reduce NAs.

### Data Coverage

- All 5,214 islets have peri-islet data (100% coverage)
- Donor 6533 has 191 islets (fully integrated after Parent annotation fix)
- Biological validation: T1D immune_frac_peri > Aab+ > ND (immune infiltration increases with disease progression)

## Single-Cell Drill-Down

Click any islet data point in the Plot or Trajectory tab to inspect individual cells.

### How It Works

1. Click a point in the scatter/UMAP plot
2. A segmentation panel appears below the plot with the title showing the islet name and donor info (case ID, disease status, age, sex)

### Panel Layout

- **Left sidebar**: Layer toggles (Single Cells, Peri Boundary, Structures), Color-by dropdown, Phenotype Palette, Show peri-islet cells checkbox. When no cell data is available, shows a boundary legend instead.
- **Center**: Segmentation map with GeoJSON boundaries and optional single-cell overlay
- **Right sidebar**: Cell composition bar chart and cell count table (visible when Single Cells is enabled)

### Single Cells View

- **Color by**: Phenotype (21 categorical colors) or any of 31 protein markers (viridis inferno continuous scale)
- **Show peri-islet**: Toggle checkbox to include/exclude cells from the 20 μm expansion zone
  - Core cells: filled circles
  - Peri-islet cells: open circles (shape 1)
- **Summary panel**: Horizontal bar chart showing phenotype composition of the islet
- **Count table**: Core vs peri cell counts by phenotype

### Data Source

Per-islet cell CSVs in `data/cells/` (5,214 files, ~203 MB total). Each file contains:
- X/Y centroid coordinates (μm, converted to pixel space for GeoJSON overlay)
- Phenotype label (1 of 21 types)
- Region (core or peri-islet)
- Cell/Nucleus area
- 31 protein marker expression values

### Availability

- All 5,214 islets have cell data
- If cell data is unavailable for a clicked islet, the panel shows "Boundaries" mode with a message

## AI Assistant

An embedded AI chat panel powered by the University of Florida Navigator AI Toolkit. Ask questions about your data, plots, statistics, or troubleshooting steps.

### How to Use

1. Type a question in the text area at the bottom of the AI panel (right side of the app)
2. Select a model:
   - **Navigator Fast (gpt-oss-20b)** — Quick responses for simple questions (default)
   - **Navigator Large (gpt-oss-120b)** — More capable reasoning model for complex analysis questions. Shows "Thinking..." while reasoning, then displays the answer.
3. Click **Send** or press Enter
4. Use **New Conversation** to clear chat history and start fresh

### Model Selection Tips

- Use **Fast** for quick lookups: "What markers are in the heatmap?", "How many islets are shown?"
- Use **Large** for analytical questions: "Why does immune infiltration increase in T1D?", "How should I interpret this AUC result?"
- The Large model takes longer to respond because it reasons through the problem before answering

### Token Budget

The app tracks cumulative token usage. If a budget limit is configured (via `OPENAI_TOKEN_BUDGET`), the chat will notify you when the budget is reached. Start a new browser session to reset.

### Requirements

The AI assistant requires:
- `KEY` and `BASE` environment variables configured in `.Renviron`
- The `httr2` R package installed
- Network access to the UF Navigator API endpoint

If credentials are missing, the chat panel displays a configuration message instead of responding.

## Data Pipeline

### Rebuilding the App Data

The canonical pipeline rebuilds `data/islet_explorer.h5ad` from source:

```bash
# Activate the Python environment
conda activate scvi-env

# Step 1: Reaggregate islets + trajectory + Leiden (~15 min)
python scripts/reaggregate_islets.py
# → islet_analysis/islets_core_fixed.h5ad (5,214 islets)
# → data/adata_ins_root.h5ad (+ pseudotime + UMAP)
# → islet_analysis/islets_core_clustered.h5ad (+ Leiden at 4 resolutions)

# Step 2: Compute neighborhood metrics (from 2.6M-cell single-cell H5AD)
python scripts/compute_neighborhood_metrics.py
# → data/neighborhood_metrics.csv (5,214 rows × 62 cols)

# Step 3: Extract per-islet cell CSVs (for drill-down viewer)
python scripts/extract_per_islet_cells.py
# → data/cells/*.csv (5,214 files, ~203 MB)

# Step 4: Extract per-donor tissue CSVs (for Spatial tab scatter, independent of islet filtering)
python scripts/extract_per_donor_tissue.py
# → data/donors/*.csv (15 files, ~78 MB)

# Step 5: Build enriched H5AD (trajectory + groovy + neighborhood + Leiden + donor metadata)
python scripts/build_h5ad_for_app.py
# → data/islet_explorer.h5ad (~70 MB)
```

## Deployment & Administration

### Architecture

```
nginx (port 8080)
  ↓ reverse-proxy /islet-explorer/
shiny-server (port 3838)
  ↓ symlink /srv/shiny-server/islet-explorer → app/shiny_app/
Shiny app (R worker process)
```

### Updating the App

Code changes take effect when shiny-server spawns a new R worker. No restart is needed for code-only changes.

If a stale R worker persists with old code:
```bash
# Find and kill stale Shiny R workers
ps aux | grep R | grep shiny
kill <PID>
```

Note: `sudo systemctl restart shiny-server` is not available — use the worker kill approach above.

### Local Development

```bash
cd app/shiny_app
Rscript -e 'shiny::runApp(".", port = 7777)'
# Then open http://localhost:7777 in browser
```

Port 7777 is for local testing only and is not accessible to end users.

### R Dependencies

```
shiny, shinyjs, plotly, ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, readxl, sf, jsonlite,
RColorBrewer, scales, anndata, reticulate, lmerTest, lme4, emmeans
```

### Python Dependencies (pipeline only)

```bash
conda activate scvi-env
# scanpy, anndata, scvi-tools, sklearn, scib-metrics, scipy, pandas, numpy
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### App fails to load

1. Check that `data/islet_explorer.h5ad` exists and is ~70 MB
2. Check that R packages are installed: `library(anndata); library(reticulate)`
3. Check that Python is accessible via reticulate: `reticulate::py_available()`
4. Fall back to Excel: ensure `data/master_results.xlsx` exists (reduced functionality)

### No phenotype or demographic filters

The app is running from Excel fallback. Rebuild the H5AD:
```bash
conda activate scvi-env
python scripts/build_h5ad_for_app.py
```

### No neighborhood metrics in Plot selector

1. Verify `data/neighborhood_metrics.csv` exists (5,214 rows)
2. Rebuild the H5AD: `python scripts/build_h5ad_for_app.py`
3. Kill stale R workers and refresh the browser

### Single-cell drill-down not available

1. Verify `data/cells/` directory contains ~5,023 CSV files
2. If missing, regenerate: `python scripts/extract_per_islet_cells.py`

### Segmentation viewer shows "No GeoJSON found"

1. Check that `data/json/` or `data/gson/` has `.geojson` / `.geojson.gz` files
2. Case ID zero-padding: GeoJSON files use 4-digit padded IDs (`0112.geojson`), data uses unpadded (`112`). The app handles this automatically via `sprintf("%04d", ...)` fallback.

### Statistics tab shows no results

The Statistics tab uses data from the Plot sidebar. Ensure:
1. A feature is selected in the Plot sidebar
2. At least 2 disease groups are checked
3. The diameter range includes some islets

### Spatial tab tissue scatter is empty

1. Verify `data/donors/` directory contains 15 CSV files
2. If missing, regenerate: `python scripts/extract_per_donor_tissue.py`
3. If Leiden panel says "not available", rebuild the H5AD with Leiden data: `python scripts/build_h5ad_for_app.py` (requires `islet_analysis/islets_core_clustered.h5ad`)

### AI assistant shows error or no response

1. **"LLM key not found"**: Set `KEY=your-api-key` and `BASE=https://api.ai.it.ufl.edu` in `~/.Renviron` or `app/shiny_app/.Renviron`
2. **"key not allowed to access model"**: The selected model isn't available. Verify available models with `GET /v1/models`. Current models: `gpt-oss-20b` and `gpt-oss-120b`.
3. **Authentication error (401)**: Confirm the API key is valid and has no extra whitespace
4. **Timeout or empty response**: The Large model (120b) needs time for reasoning. Try the Fast model (20b) for quicker responses, or increase the timeout.
5. **"httr2 package required"**: Install with `install.packages('httr2')` and restart the app
6. **Debug mode**: Set `DEBUG_CREDENTIALS=1` in `.Renviron` and check the R console output for credential loading details

### Leiden UMAP shows a blob

The Leiden UMAP visualization uses raw marker PCA coordinates (same as the Trajectory tab). If it shows a blob, the clustered H5AD may have outdated scVI-based UMAP coordinates. Fix:
1. Copy visualization UMAP from `data/adata_ins_root.h5ad` into `islet_analysis/islets_core_clustered.h5ad`
2. Rebuild: `python scripts/build_h5ad_for_app.py`
3. Kill stale R workers and refresh
